## Working Notes

### Installation & Setup

#### Required Install

- .NET Core 6 SDK
- VS Code

Installed in the same drive, which has to be the C drive for .NET Core. 

#### Required VS Code Extensions

- Azure App Services
- C#
- Azure Accounts

During setup, I got a few errors related to "OmniSharp" in the output window - '''OmniSharp.MSBuild.ProjectManager Attempted to update project that is not loaded'''. I chose to ignore this error and the application ran as expected without resolving it. 

### Running the App

You can run the application directly in the VS Code interface using the '''run -> Start Debugging''' click sequence. 

The application will run on '''https://localhost:5001/'''
